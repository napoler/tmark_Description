点评翻译：我们走进去感觉我们终于来到了一家真正的印度餐厅啦……从进门感觉就很好哦……印度老板欢迎了我们……哇塞,这里越来越好了呢……员工面带微笑的把我们带到我们的座位上,整个晚上都是超赞呢,饭菜很好吃哦,然而,所有的厨师都是从印度来的,还想期待啥啊,在中国能看到真正的印度厨师真的是很高兴哦(老板是怎么吧他们从海关那里带过来的呀),透过窗看着厨师们用粘土炉子做饭感觉很不错哦,我个人推荐炉烤的羊腿,非常好吃哦……这里的气氛也很好哦,装饰很棒,灯光也很美呢……价格也是在预料之中的呢……总之,我们还会再来的哦,真的是超赞的夜晚啊……又一个好地方哦……

点评原文：

We walked in and felt like we were at last in a real Indian
restaurant.....Fantastic start...Greeted by the owner who is Indian... wow
this place is getting better......the staff showed us to our seats with a
smile and were excellent all night, the food was excellent, but what would you
expect when all the chefs are from Indian, great to see real Indian chefs in
China (how did the owner get them through customs), nice to se the Chefs
through a window making the food in the Tan door, personally I would recommend
the Lamb from the Tan door it was superb....atmosphere was good, great decor
and lighting...price was what I expected...overall we will be back, great
nigh....one more Kingfisher......更多
