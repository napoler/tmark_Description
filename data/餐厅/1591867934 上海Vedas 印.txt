 上海Vedas 印度餐厅(常熟路店)的点评，点评得分5，上海Vedas 印度餐厅(常熟路店)用户评价，上海Vedas 印度餐厅(常熟路店)推荐菜-Tripadvisor(猫途鹰) 
点评翻译：我们来过这儿几次了,这家饭店是我们在上海最喜欢的一家。我以前从来没有尝试过印度菜因为我觉得印度菜口味太重了。我们第一次去吠陀是在周末,去尝尝他们的周末中午自助餐(所有的食物都能吃)。恰到好处的美味让我感到惊讶。虽然挺辛辣,但是让我有了美妙的体验,以至于改变了我对印度餐的观念。现在这家店成了我的最爱之一。
从那时起,我去了其他一些印度餐厅,我不得不说它们都让我感到失望。因为它们跟吠陀比起来在品质和口味上都相差甚远。至今,在澳大利亚我都没找到一家能比得上吠陀的印度餐厅。。。。。。
吠陀的装修不是很花哨,但是非常时尚而优雅,很干净。员工很不错,尤其是2个印度服务员,他们是我遇见过的最礼貌的服务员了。他们人很好。我和父母跟印度老板私下是朋友,他们非常有个性,而且热爱他们的餐馆事业。
我强烈推荐大家去这个地方尝尝。老板一家最近搬家去了印度尼西亚,不过他们还在经营着这家饭馆。
如果你从菜单上单点,价格会挺贵,不过周末的中午自助餐很值,价格是150 RMB,。

点评原文：

We have been here several times, it is our favourite in Shanghai. I haven't
really had tried Indian cuisine before, because I thought it's too rich and
heavy. We went to Vedas first on a Sunday to try their sunday brunch (all-u-
can-eat). I was surprised how tasty, well balanced the flavours were. It was
pretty spicy though but I had a fantastic experience that has changed my
opinion on Indian dishes and now today it is one of my favourites.  
Since then I visited a few other Indian restaurants, and I have to tell, they
all disappointed me, because I was comparing them to Vedas, and they were all
way below the quality and flavours of Vedas! I still haven't found an Indian
restaurant here in Australia, that would match up with them...  
The decor of the place is not too fancy but very stylish and elegant, very
clean. The staff is great, especially the two Indian waiters, they are the
most polite waiters I've ever met. They are very nice. Me and my partner are
personal friends with the native Indian owners who are absolutely fantastic,
and very passionate about their restaurant.  
I highly recommend to check out the place. The owner's family recently
relocated to Indonesia, but they are still running the restaurant.  
If you choose from the menu, it can be pricey but the Sunday brunch well worth
it, it was 150 RMB p.p.更多
