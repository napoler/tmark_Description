 天津芭瓦琪印度餐厅的点评，点评得分5，天津芭瓦琪印度餐厅用户评价，天津芭瓦琪印度餐厅推荐菜-Tripadvisor(猫途鹰) 
点评翻译：这家餐厅位于上谷商业中心(Shanguu business complex),三层,苹果俱乐部(Apple
Club)的对过。这块儿属于繁华地带,所以周末你总会见到有人进进出出的。 可以预订,极力建议周末来之前要预订。这个地方最多坐大约50人。
椅子是白色的软软的,桌子是硬木的。很体面、干净,周围有很多外国人,但是这里不是那种桌子上点着蜡烛,超级浪漫的地方。
服务员很周到,体贴,能说些英语。菜单也是中英双语的。
菜单上从素菜,到羊肉,到咖喱应有尽有。调味品加多少,可以按你的口味做。面包很薄的那种。菜单上还有很多海鲜可以点。上来的蔬菜很新鲜。 这里有酸奶,也有酒。
餐单上提示道,因为咖喱是现做,所以要等上20-30分钟。所以建议点一个开胃菜。 一份咖喱饭,一个面包,一份饮料和沙拉总共花了我112元。非常值。

点评原文：

The location is hard to find in the Shanguu business complex. It is found on
the opposite side of the Apple Club and on the third floor. It is a busy area
and you most likely will spot someone on their way in or out on the weekends.  
  
Reservations are taken and highly suggested for the weekends. The space seats
about 50 maximum.  
  
The decor white soft chairs and hardwood tables. It is decent and clean with
many foreigners but this is not the high end romantic with candle lit tables.  
  
The severs are attentive and can speak some English. The menus are in English
and Chinese.  
  
The menu ranges from vegan to lamb and chicken curries. You can ask for you
level of spice. The nan is a thin style. The menu has many options including
seafood. The veggies were served fresh.  
  
Yogurt drinks as well as alcohol is available.  
  
A note in the menu explains to wait 20-30 minutes for curries as they are
freshly made so ordering an appetizer is recommended.  
  
Prices for one curry, nan, drink, and salad was 112 RMB. A good deal.更多
