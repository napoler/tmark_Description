**会议室 夜 内**

鸥夏尔：队长，你该休息一下了，接下来的任务会更加繁重的。  
Michelle: Captain, you should take a break. The next encounter will be much
more taxing.  
明队长：我总是很佩服你，能在最短的时间里找到我，不管我在哪儿，你都能做到这一点。  
Colonel Steele: You know what I really admire about you? Your ability to find
me in the shortest amount of time no matter where I am hiding.  
鸥夏尔：队长……  
Michelle: Captain…  
明队长：为什么长老会会做出这样不可理喻的决定？  
Colonel Steele: how is it that the council of elders always come to these
unreasonable decisions?  
明队长：要知道，撤退意味着什么？（双拳紧握）我们将为此付出更多的代价，（挥舞着拳头）这些原本是没有必要的，没有必要。  
Colonel Steele: why？ Why do they think this retreat makes sense? This retreat
isn’t necessary, we will only end up losing more ground and more troops.  
鸥夏尔：我不认同你这个观点。撤退是为了保护更多的蛙人，并不会如你所说的葬送更多的生命，绝对不会的。  
Michelle: I don’t agree with your viewpoint on this. The withdrawal is for the
protection of the Frog Tribe. If we don’t retreat we will end up losing more
people than if we do.  
明队长：你知道什么才能结束战争吗？  
Colonel Steele: You know what can end this war quickly?  
明队长：结束战争的最好方法就是进攻，一味的被动只能换来更多的苦痛。  
Colonel Steele: Aggression, the only way we can end this war is to take the
offensive. Sitting back and playing passively will not get us anywhere.  
鸥夏尔：我理解你的意思，但是对于民众……  
Michelle: I understand your strategy, but the people…  
明队长：你没有上过战场，没有亲历战争，所有的理解都是凭空想象，根本找不到立足点。  
Colonel Steele: You have never experienced the heat of battle, been in the
thick of the fighting. All you understand is from an abstract view of war and
that is not a good basis for what we’re trying to accomplish.  
鸥夏尔：对，我是没打过仗，没亲自扛着武器上过战场。但我和你们一样，都在尽最大的努力保卫家园，保护生命，而不是制造杀戮，否则我们和梯族又有什么区别？  
Michelle: you're right. I’ve never been in battle, I’ve never marched to war
with a gun on my shoulder. But like you I am doing everything I can to protect
our homes, our people, our families. We aren’t here to just fight a war and
conquer, otherwise what would separate us from the Blattarians?  
明队长：军事上的事情，（朝鸥夏尔挥了挥手）你还不够成熟。  
Colonel Steele: in matters concerning war, you’re still too immature to
understand.  
鸥夏尔：这算是理由？  
Michelle: is that your idea of a logical answer?  
明队长：算是。  
Colonel Steele: yes it is.  
鸥夏尔：未免太牵强了点了吧。你还当我是刚毕业的学生？  
Michelle: I think you are taking too strong a stance on this. I’m not some
fresh grad from school.  
明队长：我并没有这么认为，立场不同而已。  
Colonel Steele: I don’t think I am. I’m just standing by what I believe will
save our people.  
鸥夏尔：好吧，立场不同，没错，但我们的目标是一致的，抗击梯族，保卫家园。所以我们需要一个最好的解决方案。  
Michelle: ok, we don’t see eye to eye on this decision. But what we do agree
on is that the Blattarians must be stopped and that our people need to be
protected. So now we need to find the best course of action to do that.  
明队长：我已经给出了最好的解决方案。  
Colonel Steele: I’ve already given you the best solution.  
鸥夏尔：可长老会已经通过了决议，撤退势在必行。  
Michelle: the council of elders has already come to a decision on this; they
have given the order to retreat.  
鸥夏尔：我能理解你现在的心情，换成我可能也会这么想的，（鸥夏尔走到大屏幕前，指了指大屏幕上的难民）看着众多的难民在受苦，有时，我也会有你那样的想法，我也想驾驶AIU上战场打上一场。可是，如果真的败了呢？  
Michelle: I can understand your current state of mind, I sometimes agree with
your way of thinking. When I look out at all the refugees and the suffering
that they have had to deal with, I wish that I had the ability to get into an
AIU and engage the enemy in battle. But, would that really save these people
from pain and suffering?  
明队长：我们AIU突击队是不会败的。  
Colonel Steele: Our AIU teams could help these people.  
鸥夏尔：我该去组织撤离的相关工作了，这事可不能耽误。  
Michelle: I need to go organize the retreat; it can’t be put off any longer.  
明队长：我想，组织撤离工作就拜托你了。  
Colonel Steele: OK. You lead the retreat.  
鸥夏尔：遵命。  
Michelle: Yes sir.
