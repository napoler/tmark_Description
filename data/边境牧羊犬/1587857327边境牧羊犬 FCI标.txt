边境牧羊犬(Border Collie)FCI标准(英文版)  
Border Collie  
Working

Group: Working  
Size: medium  
Lifespan: 10-14 years  
Exercise: very high  
Grooming: medium  
Trainability: very high  
Watchdog ability: high  
Protection ability: medium  
Area of Origin: border of Scotland and England  
Date of Origin: 1800’s  
Other Names: none  
Original Function: sheep herding

CHARACTERISTICS:  
The Border Collie is highly intelligent, with an instinctive tendency to work
and is readily responsive to training. It's keen, alert and eager expression
add to its intelligent appearance, whilst its loyalty and faithful nature
demonstrates that it is at all times kindly disposed towards stock. Any aspect
of structure or temperament foreign to a working dog is uncharacteristic.  
GENERAL APPEARANCE:  
The general appearance should be that of a well proportioned dog, the smooth
outline showing quality, gracefulness and perfect balance, combined with
sufficient substance to ensure that it is capable of enduring long periods of
activity in its intended task as a working sheepdog. Any tendency to
coarseness or weediness is undesirable.  
Head:  
The skull is broad and flat between the ears, slightly narrowing to the eye
with a pronounced stop cheeks deep but not prominent. The muzzle, tapering to
the nose, is strong and the same length as the skull. The lips are tight and
clean and the nose is large with open nostrils. The nose colour in all dogs
will be a solid colour with no pink or light pigment, and shall compliment the
backgrounds colour of the dog .  
Eyes:  
The eyes are set wide apart, oval shaped of moderate size harmonising with the
colour of the coat but darker colour preferred, except in the case of
chocolate where a lighter colour is permissable and in the case of merles
where blue is permissable. The expression is mild but keen, alert and
intelligent.  
Ears:  
The ears should be of medium size and texture, set well apart, carried semi-
erect and sensitive in their use and inside well furnished with hair.  
Mouth:  
The teeth should be sound, strong and evenly spaced, the lower incisors just
behind but touching the upper, that is a scissor bite..  
Neck:  
The neck is of good length, strong and muscular, slightly arched and
broadening to the shoulders, without throatiness or coarseness.  
Forequarters:  
The shoulders are long and well angulated to the upper arm, neither in nor out
at the elbow. The forelegs are well boned, straight and parallel when viewed
from the front. Pasterns show flexibility with a slight slope when viewed from
the side.  
Body:  
The body is moderately long with well-sprung ribs tapering to a fairly deep
and moderately broad chest.. The loins are broad, deep and muscular with well
turned stifles and strong hocks, well let down, and when viewed from the rear
are straight and parallel..  
Hindquarters:  
The hindquarters are broad and muscular, in profile sloping gracefully to the
set on of the tail. The thighs are long, broad, deep, muscular with well
turned stifles and strong hocks, well let down, and when viewed from the rear
are straight and parallel.

Feet:  
Oval in shape, pads deep, strong and sound, toes moderately arched and close
together. Nails short and strong.  
Tail:  
The tail is moderately long, set on low, well furnished with an upward swirl
towards the end, completing the graceful contour and balance of the dog. The
tail may be raised in excitement but not carried over the back.  
Movement:  
The movement is free, smooth and tireless, with a minimum lift of the feet,
conveying the impression of the ability to move with great stealth. The
action, viewed from the front, should be straight forward and true, without
weakness at shoulders, elbows or pasterns. Viewed from behind the quarters
thrust with strength and flexibility, with hocks not close nor too far apart.
When trotting, the dog's feet tend to come closer together as speed increases,
but when the dog comes to rest he should stand four square. Any tendency to
stiltiness or to cowhocks or bowhocks is a serious fault.  
Coat:  
Double coated, with a moderately long, dense, medium textured topcoat while
the undercoat is short, soft and dense, making a weather resisting protection
with an abundant coat to form a mane, breeching and brush. On face, ear tips,
forelegs (except for feather), hindlegs from hock to ground, the hair is short
and smooth. A smooth coat is acceptable.  
Colour:  
A variety of colours is permissible, but white should never predominate.  
Size:  
Height: Dogs 48-53 cm (approx 19-21 in) at withers  
Bitches 46-51 cm (approx. 18-20 in) at withers  
Faults:  
Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault and the
seriousness of the fault should be in exact proportion to its degree.  
Note:  
Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully descended into
the scrotum.
